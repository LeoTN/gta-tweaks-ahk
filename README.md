**Hotkeys for GTA V Online**

This program adds hotkeys for GTA V Online actions such as **creating a solo lobby**, **depositing cash** or flying the Cayo Perico plane (to start the heist) automatically.

## Installation

>  1. Download the installer archive from [here](https://github.com/LeoTN/gtav-tweaks/releases/latest/download/GTAV_Tweaks.zip).
>  2. Extract the folder, move the file **GTAV_Tweaks.exe** to a desired location (or leave it there for now) and run it.
>  3. Due to a missing digital certificate, you will be shown a Windows Defender message.
>  4. If you "acknowledge" this message, you are set.
>  5. You can choose to perform future updates automatically.

## Currently available hotkeys

>  **You can change every hotkey in the config file.**

| Hotkey     | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CTRL + F9* | Keeps the Cayo Perico Heist preparation plane in the air automatically.                         |
| CTRL + F10 | Creates a GTA V Online solo lobby (as if you would do it with Task Manager).                    |
| CTRL + F11*| Deposit less than 100k cash into your bank account.                                             |
| CTRL + F12*| Deposit more than 100k cash into your bank account.                                             |

***This hotkey is still under development and might not work as expected.**

## Macros

I also created a simple *macro recorder* in AutoHotkey. It is used to create macros for some of the script's hotkeys.

For example, you **need to record a macro** in order **to use the cash depositing hotkeys**.

Don't worry!

**Once** you have **recorded** a macro, you can **use it from now on**. There *might* be a feature in future updates to **create** your **own hotkeys** with a matching macro, who knows.

More information about this topic, including a FAQ section, can be found in the README file located in the [latest installer archive](https://github.com/LeoTN/gtav-tweaks/releases/latest/download/GTAV_Tweaks.zip).
