**Hotkeys for GTA V Online**

This program adds hotkeys for GTA V Online actions such as creating a solo lobby, depositing cash or flying the Cayo Perico plane automatically.

## Installation

> 1. Download the installer archive from [here](https://github.com/LeoTN/gtav-tweaks/latest/download/GTAV_Tweaks.zip).

> 3. Due to a missing digital certificate, you will be shown a Windows Defender message.
> 4. If you "ignore" this message, you are set.
