**Hotkeys for GTA V Online**

This program adds **hotkeys** in combination with **macros** for GTA V Online. You can even create your **very own hotkeys**.

## Installation

>  1. Download the installer archive from [here](https://github.com/LeoTN/gtav-tweaks/releases/latest/download/GTAV_Tweaks.zip).
>  2. Extract the archive, move both the **GTAV_Tweaks_Setup.exe** and **GTAV_Tweaks.exe** to a desired location (or leave them there for now). Just make sure they are in the **same folder**.
>  3. Execute the **GTAV_Tweaks_Setup.exe** and you are done.

You can find all releases (including beta versions) [here](https://github.com/LeoTN/gtav-tweaks/releases).

## Currently available built-in hotkeys

>  **You can change every hotkey in the config file or use the hotkey overview window.**

| Hotkey     | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CTRL + F9* | Keeps the Cayo Perico Heist preparation plane in the air automatically.                         |
| CTRL + F10 | Creates a GTA V Online solo lobby (as if you would do it with Task Manager).                    |

***This hotkey is still under development and might not work as expected.**

## Create your own macros & hotkeys

To make this possible, I also created a simple *macro recorder* in AutoHotkey.

You can **record** your **own macros** and execute them with a **keyboard shortcut of your choice**.

More information about this topic, including a FAQ section, can be found in the README file located in the [latest installer archive](https://github.com/LeoTN/gtav-tweaks/releases/latest/download/GTAV_Tweaks.zip).

## Features

* It is possible to create **custom GTA V actions**, for instance calling NPCs on the phone, depositing cash into your bank account and so on. You can achieve this by creating **macros** and binding them to **hotkeys**.


* Ability to mute GTA V during launch and unmute it, once you start playing.

* Many customizable script startup options, for example an autostart feature or a silent launch.

## Credits & License

*  **NirSoft** (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/sound_volume_view.html) for providing such an incredibly useful application.

I appreciate your **constructive** and **honest** feedback. Feel free to create an **issue** or **feature request**.
